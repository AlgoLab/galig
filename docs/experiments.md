# Experiments

This page contains information on how to replicate the experiments described in _ASGAL_ paper.

To create a fully reproducible data analysis, we used the [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow manager.

[Here](https://github.com/AlgoLab/galig/tree/master/paper/experiments) you can find the _snakefiles_ used to perform our experiments on simulated and real data. From these files, you can inspect how we ran each tool and which parameters we used.

We are currently cleaning our data directory. Once done, we will upload it and you will be able to fully replicate the experiments we performed.
