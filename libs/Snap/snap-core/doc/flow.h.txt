/// TSnap::GetMaxFlowIntEK
Implements max flow using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm
Although the asymptotic run time of Edmonds-Karp is worse than that of Push Relabel, in practice Edmonds Karp works very well, especially if the network is sparse.
Unless the degree of each node is on the order of the number of nodes, it is best to use Edmonds Karp over Push Relabel.

/// TSnap::GetMaxFlowIntPR
Implements max flow using the Push-Relabel algorithm. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%E2%80%93relabel_maximum_flow_algorithm
The Global Relabel and Gap Relabel heuristics were also implemented to speed up the algorithm. http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FPL00009180
